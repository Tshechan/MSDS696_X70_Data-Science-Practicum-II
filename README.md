**1. Project Description**

  A. Project Introduction
  
The year of 2020 had a historic rise of demonstrations across the United States calling to 'Defund the Police.' The funding trend of increasing police spending was reversed for the first time in years by reducing the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) budget by $150 million.

In this project, we have analyzed the available crime data by simple exploratory data analysis and using Machine learning to predict the crimes that occur in Los Angeles.


  B. Problem Statement
  
Los Angeles police department is one of the largest in the country, with jurisdiction of around 4 million people. Through this project we identified which areas and populations in LA have been hit the hardest by crime in past few years. Furthermore, this project studied the following business problem from the data:
1. Crime changes during the time period of study
2. Areas in LA with highest reported crime.
3. Top impacted demographics in LA.


**2. Data Collection**

The crime data  Los Angles Crime data  for this project will be taken from the city of Los Angeles website.
The data reflects incidents of crime in the City of Los Angeles


**3. Generic Flow Of Project**

A. Data cleaning 

B. Data Exploration and Visualizations

C. Model Approach and development

D. Model Validation and comparision

E. Predictions

**4. EDA**

      

  

**5. Model Approach**




**6. Conclusion**





**7. Limitation and Future Considerations**

Gather more historical data to help make stronger predictions and forecasts further into the future.
Include exogenous variables from census data to add complexity to the univariate model.
Implement a Facebook Prophet model for comparision and model evaluation.
Use incoming data to evaluate our model's forecasting performance
